# FrameSelect
FrameSelect is a JavaFX based application that takes a gif and shows you every frame in it.
I wanted to take a picture from a gif and use it as a wallpaper and that led me to making this project.
This project taught me how gifs work, how to use the basics of github, and it also reinforced my JavaFX knowledge.
